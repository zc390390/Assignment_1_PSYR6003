##Question 1
#Utilizing the read.csv function, we can read the avengers csv into a dataframe. 
#Then with na.omit, we can remove participants who have missing data anywhere. 
```{R}
df <- read.csv('avengers.csv')
df <- na.omit(df)
```


##Question 2
#We can simply add the four variable stogether with additional symbols, using the arrow to put the added variables into the new variable CombatEffectiveness
#After that we can use dplyr to select our variables of interest with the new variable, ensuring it was added correctly.
```{R}

df$CombatEffectiveness <- df$agility + df$speed + df$strength + df$willpower
dfselect <- df %>% select(CombatEffectiveness, speed, agility, strength, willpower)
head(dfselect, 5) 
```


##Question 3
#First we can use dplyrs filter method, with the arguments that the superpower variable must be no and died must be yes.
#Using functions write.csv and write_sav from haven, we can create a csv and a sav file (sav is for spss).
#Finally, to see whats going on in the dataset with these participants. We can group the dataset between north and south, which will then seperately give us information on the mean/SD/min/max of combat effectiveness, kills, and injuries. 
#We then write it again. 
```{R}
dfsum <- df %>%
  filter(superpower == 'no' & died == 'yes')
write.csv(dfsum, 'CSVRAWdead&nosuperpower')
write_sav(dfsum, 'SAVRAWdead&nosuperpower')

dfsum1 <- dfsum %>%
  group_by(north_south) %>%
  summarize(meanCE = mean(CombatEffectiveness),
            sdCE = sd(CombatEffectiveness), 
            minCE = min(CombatEffectiveness),
            maxCE = max(CombatEffectiveness),
            meanKILL = mean(kills),
            sdKILL = sd(kills),
            minKILL = min(kills),
            maxKILL = max(kills),
            meanINJ = mean(injuries),
            sdINJ = sd(injuries),
            minINJ = min(injuries),
            maxINJ = max(injuries))
write.csv(dfsum1, 'CSVSUMdead&nosuperpower')
write_sav(dfsum1, 'SAVSUMdead&nosuperpower')
```



##Question 4
#Using t.test to see if there are statistically significant differences between 
```{R}
dfs1 <- dfsum %>%
  filter(north_south == 'north')
dfs2 <- dfsum %>%
  filter(north_south == 'south')
t.test(dfs1$CombatEffectiveness, dfs2$CombatEffectiveness)
t.test(dfs1$injuries, dfs2$injuries)
t.test(dfs1$kills, dfs2$kills)
```

#Question 6
#
```{R}
dfq6a <- df %>%
  filter(superpower == 'yes')
dfq6b <- df %>%
  filter(superpower == 'no')
```

#Question 7 and 8
#Since we are doing the smallest effect size of interest, 0.2, then 
```{R}
pwr.t.test(d = 0.2, sig.level = 0.05, power = 0.8, alternative = c("two.sided"))
```

##Question 9 
#
```{R}
powerTOSTtwo(alpha = 0.05, statistical_power = 0.8, low_eqbound_d = 0.2, high_eqbound_d = 0.2)
```
##Question 10
#
```{R}
n1 <- length(dfq6a$iq)
n2 <- length(dfq6b$iq)
t = 4.25

t_to_d(t, df_error = n1+n2-2, paired = FALSE)
```
